# --- 1. Static PHP via static-php-cli --------------------------------------
# Build branchfs directly into the php binary as a builtin extension.
#
# On fully-static Linux PHP (musl), dlopen does not work, so there's no way
# to load an external branchfs.so at runtime. Rather than maintain two
# separate integration paths (dylib load on mac, builtin on Linux), we build
# branchfs into PHP itself on every platform via static-php-cli's patch hook
# (scripts/spc-patch-branchfs.php). The php binary thereby carries branchfs
# natively — no `-d extension=...` flag, no separate .so in the dist/ layout.
